                <p>"After completing <a href='https://platform.manchestercodes.com/'> Manchester Codes</a> excellent bootcamp, finishing in July 2022 I have taken some time to get the other aspects of my world in order. What I mean by this is that I thought I would have no problem welcoming my first child, purchasing a property and changing my career path all at the same time would be absolutly fine.
